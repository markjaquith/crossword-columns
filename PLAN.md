# Crossword Layout Plan

## Requirements

1. Layout Structure:
   - n columns of equal width (starting with n=5)
   - Columns will be populated by two arrays of clues: "down" and "across"
   - Each clue should have a number and the clue text

2. Puzzle Display:
   - Rendered as a solid rectangle placeholder
   - Dimensions: 400px width Ã— 500px height
   - Position: Upper-right corner
   - Width: Three columns wide

3. Text Balancing:
   - Text between columns should be balanced
   - Height difference between columns should be no more than one line of text

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: CSS Grid + JavaScript for Text Balancing

- Use CSS Grid for the overall layout
- Create a grid with n columns for clues plus 3 columns for the puzzle
- Position the puzzle in the upper-right using grid positioning
- Use JavaScript to dynamically distribute clues across columns to achieve balanced heights
- Pros: Precise control over text distribution
- Cons: Requires JavaScript for text balancing

### Approach 2: CSS Multi-column Layout + Flexbox

- Use CSS multi-column layout for clue sections
- Set `column-count` to n (5 initially)
- Use Flexbox for overall page layout with the puzzle positioned absolutely
- Use `column-fill: balanced` for automatic text balancing
- Pros: Simpler implementation with less JavaScript
- Cons: Less precise control over column balancing

### Approach 3: CSS Grid + Column-span for Puzzle

- Use CSS Grid for the entire layout
- Create a grid with n columns
- Make the puzzle span 3 columns and position it at the top-right
- Use CSS Grid's auto-placement to flow text around the puzzle
- Pros: Clean, modern approach with good browser support
- Cons: May require additional logic for perfect text balancing

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Clue {
  number: number;
  text: string;
}

interface ClueSet {
  across: Clue[];
  down: Clue[];
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Create basic HTML structure
2. Implement CSS for the chosen approach
3. Add JavaScript for text balancing if needed
4. Test with sample clue data
5. Implement responsive design considerations
